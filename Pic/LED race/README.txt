Designed, programmed, and implemented a minigame controlled by the microcontroller 18F47J53, coded in C language, it included SPI communication with an EEPROM. It's an "obstacle course game" consisting of an 8x8 LED matrix that scrolled through a map represented by turned-on LEDs, a single LED represented the playable "character" who moved along the x-axis to sort out the obstacles. The game also stored information, like the level currently being played and a point system that got stored in the EEPROM.
