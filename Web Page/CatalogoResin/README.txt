Currently, I am in the process of developing a web page that serves as an online catalog for a small company specializing in resin accessories. The page will showcase their projects in an organized manner and enable users to interactively create their own personalized accessories with multiple customization options, including type, image, color gradient, and direction. Users can then submit this information for the later manufacturing of the product.
